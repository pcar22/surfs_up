# surfs_up
 
## Overview
W. Avy wanted more information about temperature trends, specifically, he wants teperature data for the months of June and December. This information will be used to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
- The count in June is 1700 and the count in December is 1517, and that is about an 11% difference in counts.

- The minimum temperature in June is not much higher than it is in December. June minimum is 64, while December is 56.

- Standard deviation is 3.25 for June and 3.74 for December.

## Summary
Overall the temperatures between June and December are fairly close and while 75 degrees is warmer than 71 degrees, I am not sure if that would make much of a difference while you are in the water surfing. Both temperatures will melt ice scream, and maybe at an average of 74 degrees, the June temperatures would get more people to buy ice scream. 
- I ran two more queries on the precipitation. One for the month of June and one for the month of December.
- The average precipitation for December is almost double that of June, however if you look at the median the difference is very slight. There appear to be outliers in both months and if you look at the STD it appears the data points are rather dispersed.
